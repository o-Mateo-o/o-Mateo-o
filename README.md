## About me

Peace with you! I am a **Software Engineer** who is particularly interested in **data-related** projects. Currently, I am studying **Applied Mathematics** at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology (where my area of focus is agent-based modeling), while also working a job.  :computer: :bar_chart: :books: 

During my free time, I enjoy playing music and making meaningful contributions to the communities I belong to. :musical_keyboard: :raised_hands:
